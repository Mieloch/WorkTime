Top Worker

Idea on this project appears in my last part time job.
Sometimes I was in the office in diffrent time and I was wondering if I worked enought to reach my contract limit.
Main need was to write down time spent on office each day but I never had much motivation to do that consistently.

I created client+server application where client collects data and persist them on server.
Data about time spent on work are send by HTTP post request to web application REST API.
Each user have his own collection of work periods stored in DB. 

Web application is based on Spring Boot and Hibernate connected with PostgreSQL. User interface was developed in Vaadin framework.
In my opinion its great solution to quickly implement handy and good looking UI. Interface allows to present stored information
in two views: calendar or list. 
Calendar gives more chronological perspective and list allows summary working time in selected period.

There are some other features like monthly report on working time send by email and user authentication.

I have some stuff to implement like:
- sending email via mailgun.com after DNS proper configuration
- account management 
- internationalization

Application should be available on:
