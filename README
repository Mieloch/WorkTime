Top Worker

Idea on this project appears in my last part time job.
Sometimes I was in the office in diffrent hour and I was wondering if I worked enought time to reach my contract limit.

Web application is based on Spring and Hibernate connected to PostgreSQL. User interface was developed in Vaadin framework.
In my opinion its great solution to quickly implement handy and good looking UI.
Data about time spent on work are collected from desktop client via HTTP and REST API. 
There are some other features like monthly report on working time send by email and user authentication.
